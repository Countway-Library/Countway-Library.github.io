	<h2>What is Research Data Management?</h2>
	<p>Data Management is the process of providing the appropriate labeling, storage, and access for data at all stages of a research project. We recognize that best practices for each of these aspects of data management can and often do change over time, and are different for different stages in the data lifecycle.</p>
  	<h2>Why is Research Data Management Important?</h2>
  	<p>Research today not only has to be rigorous, innovative and insightful but it also has to be organized.  With more capacity to create and store data, there is also the challenge of making data discoverable, understandable, and reuseable. Many academic journals are requiring submission of relevent data with manuscripts to promote open access and reproducibility of research.

To address these challenges, funding agencies are increasingly mandating that research projects are developed with data management and sharing plans in place. This includes accounting for security, accessibility, sharing, storage, maintenance and reuse.</p>
  	<h2>What are Countway's Data Services?</h2>
  	<p>Provide resources and guidance for research data management planning and assistance with elements of data management that will be relevent throughout your career. Learn about and explore tools and resources, including information on funding agency and institutional requirements, that help you manage your data effectively and prepare it for sharing, and reuse.
